1. Project Overview
Title: Synapse Order Status Monitor
Purpose:
The purpose of this application is to monitor and manage the status of orders, with a specific focus on orders in a delivered state. Once an order is identified as delivered, the system sends a delivery alert and updates the order record through a secondary API.

Stakeholders:
End Users: Order management team, customer support, and business analysts.
Development Team: Engineers and QA specialists.
Product Owner: Business owner responsible for feature requirements.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Order Monitoring
FR1.1: The system shall retrieve a list of orders using the FetchOrdersAsync method from an external Order API.
FR1.2: The system shall check the status of each order item to determine if it has been delivered.
2.2 Delivery Alerts
FR2.1: The system shall send a delivery alert via the SendDeliveryAlertAsync method when an item is marked as delivered.
FR2.2: The system shall attempt to send the delivery alert up to three times if an initial alert attempt fails.
2.3 Order Update
FR3.1: After processing, the system shall update each order via the UpdateOrderAsync method.
FR3.2: If an order update fails, the system shall log the failure but continue processing other orders.
2.4 Logging
FR4.1: The system shall log a success message for each alert sent using InformationTemplates.AlertSent.
FR4.2: The system shall log failures using templates, including ErrorTemplates.AlertSendFailed and ErrorTemplates.FetchOrdersFailed.
FR4.3: The system shall log exceptions and return an error response when an exception is encountered.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Reliability
The system shall have retry mechanisms for alert sending and order updates.
The system shall handle and log all exceptions gracefully to avoid application crashes.
3.2 Performance
The system should process order statuses in under 5 seconds, even with retry mechanisms in place.
The system should be able to handle up to 100 concurrent orders without performance degradation.
3.3 Scalability
The application should be designed to scale horizontally to support increased API call volumes.
3.4 Security
All API credentials must be securely stored and accessed only by authorized services.
Logs should exclude sensitive order details beyond the necessary identifiers.
4. Technical Specifications
4.1 Language and Frameworks
Primary Language: C#
Framework: .NET Core 6 or higher
4.2 Architecture
Pattern: Layered Architecture (Application, Core, Infrastructure)
APIs: External Order API, External Alert API
Dependency Injection: Managed through the Program.cs setup.
4.3 Testing
Unit Testing: All services should be unit tested with over 80% code coverage.
Mocking: Use Moq for mocking external dependencies in tests.
Logging Templates: Verify use of InformationTemplates and ErrorTemplates.
